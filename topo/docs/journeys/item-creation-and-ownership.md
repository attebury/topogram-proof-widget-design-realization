This journey captures the most common sample-workspace flow: turning a piece of
work into a tracked item with clear ownership.

The member intent is not just to persist a row. The member needs confidence that the item belongs to the correct collection, follows ownership rules, and shows up immediately in the standard list and detail views used to manage work.

## Happy Path

1. The member starts from an active collection and opens the new-item flow.
2. The member enters the item details, including priority and an optional owner.
3. The system accepts the item only if the collection can still receive new work and the owner is active.
4. The member can immediately find the new item in item list and item detail surfaces.
5. The member can keep the flow moving by updating the item as work progresses.

## Alternate Paths

- If the collection has already been archived, item creation should stop before the new item is accepted.
- If the chosen owner is inactive, the flow should block invalid assignment instead of creating ambiguous accountability.

## Change Review Notes

Review this journey when changing item creation rules, ownership semantics, collection archival behavior, item list visibility, or the create/update item UI flow.
